  <h2>Geology
  </h2>
  <p>The northern Kawartha Lakes sit atop a bedrock primarily comprised of igneous granite and metamorphic marble, part of the Canadian Shield. In the south, there is limestone, a sedimentary rock that mitigates the effects of acid rain from industrial activity. </p>
  <p>The lakes themselves are filled with and surrounded by sediments that were deposited as the glaciers retreated, providing nutrients to the wildlife in the lakes. They also create geologic features called eskers, ridges of sand and gravel. </p>

  <h2>Forests
  </h2>
  <p>The forests of the upper Kawartha Lakes were initially comprised of maple, basswood, and pine, as well as cedar swamps. European settlers modified the landscape to more closely conform to the landscapes in their home countries, often replacing forests with large swaths of grassland and farmland. They also modifying drainage patterns to be more amenable to farming with the installation of large drainage ditches. Despite this modification, 20% of the land in the watershed is populated with beautiful hardwood and deciduous forests.</p>
  <p>Plantation Trail at Balsam Lake allows hikers to see a variety of Kawartha Lakes’ historic landscapes.</p>

  <h2>Wetlands</h2>
  <p>The Kawartha Lakes watershed contains many significant wetlands, which help reduce erosion and flooding damage, as well as improve the water quality of Kawartha’s lakes and rivers. They also sequester atmospheric carbon, fill groundwater reservoirs, and provide habitat for Kawartha Lakes wildlife. </p>


  <h2>Wildlife</h2>
  <p>The lakes contain fish species such as walleye, muskellunge, and bass, as well as various species of turtle. Birders can spot a wide variety of birds in the park, from blue birds to hawks, and cardinals to loons. Bring lots of bug spray in the summer to give you the advantage against biting insects! </p>
