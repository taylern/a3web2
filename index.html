    <h2>The Kawartha Lakes Hiking Project</h2>
    <p>The Kawartha Lakes region in Ontario has over 600 kilometres of trails, many located within local conservation areas and the Ontario Parks system. This website is intended to provide information about a selection of these hiking trails and other outdoor activities available in the parks. </p>
    <h2>About Ontario Parks and Conservation Areas</h2>
    <p>The natural landscapes, trails, and campgrounds available in Ontario’s Parks and Conservation Areas are a valuable resource for the province in many ways, from the protection of the environment and ecosystem services, to education and tourism. </p>
    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>This website was created by four GIS students from Fleming College who are passionate about hiking, the outdoors, programming, and mapping. It is also intended as a showcase of our developing web design and communication skills. </p>
